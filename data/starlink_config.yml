# Mass assumptions (can be refined as you like)
masses:
  v1:   260      # kg (Starlink v1.0)
  v15:  295      # kg (Starlink v1.5)
  v2m:  730      # kg (Starlink v2 Mini)

# Rough mix assumptions for active fleet; you can change without code
# The script will normalize these weights to 1.0
mix_active:
  v1:  0.35
  v15: 0.45
  v2m: 0.20

# Fraction mix for decayed fleet (older = more v1/v1.5 by default)
mix_decayed:
  v1:  0.65
  v15: 0.30
  v2m: 0.05

# Alumina modeling (very rough; literature varies)
# alumina_kg_per_kg_aluminum: how many kg Al2O3 produced per kg Al burned in re-entry
alumina_kg_per_kg_aluminum: 1.89   # stoichiometric max ~1.89 (Al->Al2O3). Tune down if you want a lower bound.
aluminum_fraction_of_satellite: 0.70  # fraction of satellite dry mass that's aluminum (tunable)
